# Exercise 04 - mathEquations

Replace the strings to the right of the `=` with the expression they describe. Do **not** manually enter the answers to the equation.

Currently, the variables are strings. They need to be math equations instead.

To help you, the first variable has been completed for you:
```js
const a = 1 - 1 // Freebie!!! This is the answer to "one minus one"
```

The following is an example of the **wrong** answer:
```js
const a = 0 // WRONG!!! You need to write out the equation, NOT put the result of the equation directly!
```

Feel free to run the test suite right now to see the first test pass, then go from there. Good luck!

## Hints

- Look at the docs for arithmetic operators in JavaScript for a quick reference.

- Refer back to the [Variables and Operators lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-variables-and-operators) if you are still stuck.
