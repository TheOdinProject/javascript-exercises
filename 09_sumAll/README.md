# Exercise 09 - sumAll

Implement a function that takes 2 positive integers and returns the sum of every integer between (and including) them:

```javascript
sumAll(1, 4) // returns the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 which is 10
```


## Hints

- How will you ensure you're summing all integers within the correct range, no matter the order of the inputs?

- Think about your sum's starting value. Then, how can you make sure every single number from the smaller input to the larger one (including both) gets added to it?
