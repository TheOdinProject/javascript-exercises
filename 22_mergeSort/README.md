# Exercise 22 - mergeSort

A significant amount of computer science is dedicated to sorting data. An algorithm which uses the "divide and conquer" approach
of recursion is able to reduce a sorting problem to smaller and smaller sub-problems.

Merge sort is one such sorting algorithm, and can be much faster than other algorithms such as bubble sort on the right data sets.

Essentially, merge sort recurses through an array of unsorted data until it reaches its smallest sub-set, a single item.

Of course an array with a single item is considered sorted. Merge sort then merges the single items back together in sorted order. Pretty clever!

Write a function `mergeSort` that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology. Example:

```javascript
mergeSort([3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1]) // [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
```
