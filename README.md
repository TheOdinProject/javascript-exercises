These are a series of javascript exercises intended to be used alongside the curriculum at 'The Odin Project'  They start very simply, but get more involved as you progress through them

## HOW TO USE THESE EXERCISES
Before you start you should have a few things installed on your machine:
1. NodeJS.  To check if you have it type `node -v` in a terminal.  If you get back a number that means you've got it installed.  If not, you have a few options, [check here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
 - INSERT LINK TO INSTALLING NODEJS WITH NVM HERE.
2. Jasmine.  Jasmine is a testing framework for Javascript.  Type `jasmine -v` to check for it.  If you need to install it type `npm install -g jasmine` to do so.

Each exercise includes 3 files, a markdown file with a description of the task, an empty (or mostly empty) javascript file, and a set of tests.  To complete the exercise go to the exercise directory in a terminal and run `jasmine filename.spec.js`.  This should find and run the test file and show you the output.  Upon first running the tests you will find that the tests fail: this is by design!  Your task is to open up the javascript file and write the code needed to get all of the tests to pass.

The first exercise, `helloWorld` will walk you through the process in more depth.
