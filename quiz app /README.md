Quiz App
Welcome to the Quiz App! This is a command-line quiz application designed to test your knowledge on a variety of topics. The app is written in JavaScript and uses the readline module to interact with users.

Introduction
The Quiz App is a fun and interactive way to challenge yourself or others with a series of multiple-choice questions. It's a great example of a command-line application that uses basic JavaScript concepts such as arrays, loops, functions, and user input handling.

quizApp.js
The main functionality of the Quiz App is defined in the quizApp.js file. Here's a brief overview of what the file does:

Defines an array of questions, each with multiple choices and a correct answer.

Uses the readline module to create an interface for user input.

Displays each question and prompts the user to select an answer.

Checks the user's answer against the correct answer and keeps track of the score.

Moves to the next question until all questions are answered.

Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.

Features
Multiple-Choice Questions: Each question has four choices, and the user must select the correct one.

Score Tracking: The app keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the quiz.

User Interaction: The app interacts with the user through the command line, providing an engaging experience.

Way to Solve
Understanding the Structure:

The questions array contains objects, each representing a question with its choices and correct answer.

The displayQuestion function presents the current question and choices to the user.

The checkAnswer function evaluates the user's answer and updates the score.

The nextQuestion function progresses to the next question or ends the quiz if all questions have been answered.

Implementing User Input:

The readline module is used to read user input from the command line.

The user's input is processed to determine if the answer is correct.

Tracking Progress:

Variables like currentQuestionIndex and score are used to track the user's progress through the quiz.

Solution
To solve the quiz, the user must run the quizApp.js file and answer the questions presented. The app will keep track of the score and display it at the end.

Here's how you can modify or extend the app:

Adding More Questions: Extend the questions array with more question objects to increase the length of the quiz.

Enhancing User Interaction: Improve the user interface by adding more feedback or handling invalid inputs more gracefully.

Expanding Features: Add features like time limits for each question, different difficulty levels, or a leaderboard to track high scores.

Conclusion
The Quiz App is a simple yet effective way to demonstrate key JavaScript concepts and create an engaging command-line application. Whether you're using it to test your own knowledge or as a learning tool, it's a versatile project that can be easily expanded and customized.
