# JavaScript Banking System Exercise

## Description
This exercise is designed to help you practice working with JavaScript classes, object-oriented programming (OOP), and basic financial transactions. You will implement a simple banking system that supports:

- Creating an account with an initial balance.
- Depositing money into an account.
- Withdrawing money from an account (if sufficient funds are available).
- Checking the balance of an account.
- Transferring funds between two accounts.

## Objectives
- Use JavaScript ES6+ features like classes.
- Implement object-oriented design principles.
- Ensure proper error handling for invalid transactions.
- Write test cases using Jest to verify functionality.

## Instructions
1. Implement the `BankAccount` class in `bankingSystem.js`.
2. Each account should have an `accountNumber`, `accountHolder`, and `balance`.
3. Implement methods for deposit, withdrawal, balance check, and fund transfer.
4. Write test cases in `bankingSystem.test.js` to verify the functionality.
5. Ensure all test cases pass before submission.

## Submission Guidelines
- Ensure that all test cases pass before submitting.
- Format your code properly.
- Follow JavaScript best practices.
- Submit a pull request with a meaningful description.

## Notes
This exercise will help reinforce JavaScript object-oriented concepts and error handling. Happy coding! ðŸš€
