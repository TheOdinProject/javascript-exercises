# Exercise 12 - Calculator

The goal for this exercise is to create a calculator that does the following:

1. `add()`: take two numbers and return their sum
2. `subtract()`: take two numbers and return the result after subtracting the second from the first
3. `sum()`: take an array of numbers and add all the numbers together
4. `multiply()`: take an array of numbers and multiply all the numbers together
5. `power()`: take two numbers (base and exponent) and return the result of raising the base to that exponent
6. `factorial()`: given a single number, find its [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)

Please fill out each function with your solution. Make sure to `return` the value so you can test it in Jest! To see the expected value, take a look at the `.spec.js` file that houses the Jest test cases.
