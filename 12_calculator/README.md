# Exercise 12 - Calculator

The goal for this exercise is to create a calculator that does the following:

1. **Add**: take two numbers and return their sum
2. **Subtract**: take two numbers and return their difference
3. **Total all numbers**: take an array of numbers and add all the numbers together
4. **Get the power**: take two numbers (base and exponent) and return the result of raising the base to that exponent
5. **Find factorial**

Please fill out each function with your solution. Make sure to `return` the value so you can test it in Jest! To see the expected value,
take a look at the `.spec.js` file that houses the Jest test cases.
