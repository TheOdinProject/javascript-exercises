# Exercise 13 - recursiveFibonacci

Write a recursive function `recursiveFibonacci` that takes a number `n` and returns an array
containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. 

You should already be familiar of what the fibonacci series is from an earlier exercise, but in case you have forgotten, each term in a fibonacci series is defined as the sum of the previous two terms. 

The first term of the fibonacci series is `1` and so is the second term `1` too. From there, we can find the rest of the fibonacci series.

An example:

```javascript
recursiveFibonacci(8) // [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
```
