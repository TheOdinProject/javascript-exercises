# Exercise 06 - repeatString

Write a function that simply repeats the string a given number of times:

```javascript
repeatString('hey', 3) // returns 'heyheyhey'
```

This function will take two arguments, `string` and `num`.

Use loops to implement `repeatString` rather than using the builtin `String.prototype.repeat` which has the same behaviour.

*Note:* The exercises after this one will not have arguments provided as this one does - you will need to provide them yourself from now on. So read each exercise's README carefully to see what kinds of arguments will be expected.

## Hints

- Take note of the above function call- how exactly is it being called?

- Create a variable to hold the string you're going to return, create a loop that repeats the given number of times and add the given string to the result on each loop.
